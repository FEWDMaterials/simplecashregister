# Simple Cash Register

YOU ARE TO CREATE A SIMPLE CASH REGISTER.

	THE USER INPUTS A VALUE (IE A NUMBER)
	AND YOUR "TOTAL" HTML ELEMENT MUST REFLECT THIS


	PHASE 1:
		* w/partner: SIMPLY __COMMENT__ out all these lines of code 
		  so that you are clear as to what is happening. feel free to console.log
		  as you see fit
	
	PHASE 2:
		* this register is clearly broken. fix it so that the `total` value
		is properly reflected as user adds more numbers (HINT: you will
		need to alter a function to pull this off properly)
		* using only the functions provided, update the totalSpan html
		to reflect the new total as user adds numbers
		* your code should *ALSO* clear the input field when the user hits
		the add button

	PHASE 3:
		* sanitize your input. what if the user adds gibberish or text instead of
		numbers? account for these possibilities
		* what if the user adds a '$' before or after the number? account for these
		possibilities

	PHASE 4:
		* as a user, I want to hit the enter key to be able to carry out the 
		same effect that the 'add' button carries. implement logic to achieve this
